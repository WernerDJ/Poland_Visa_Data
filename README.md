# Poland Visa Permit Data
There is a lot of controversy regarding the acceptance of immigrants from countries where the cultural background and to some extent, the religion processed are very different from the majoritarily western European, white, catholic Polish population. 
This study tries to assess whether there is a religious bias in the Visa Permit procedure (travel, work or study VISA) affecting the Visa Permit process chances of being accepted or rejected.
Another bias that could be expected is to easier accept persons coming from more developed countries where the health and education systems facilitate people achieving more in life. The Human Development Index (HDI) is an idicator that summarizes all that. 

Information on the HDI can be found here:

The databases used have been the register of Visa petitions to enter Poland for the year 2019 and the ARDA (Association of Religion Data Archives) Cross-National Socio-Economic and Religion Data (2011).

The ARDA database was actualized up to the year 2010. No significative changes were assumed in macro economy indicators like the Human Development Index (HDI) or the most professed religions by country.

There are only two years in the Polish Visa Permit database, 2018 and 2019, I decided to included only one year because neither politically, economically or almost in any sense are there any important differences between both years and because two years is too little to show any temporal progression. 

# Conclusion

There is a strong correlation between the Human Development Index (HDI) of the country of procendece of the Travel Visa requesters and the possibilities of that Visa being conceded. That correlation indicates that the main concern when a Travel Visa to Poland is being processed are connected with those factors that define the Human Development Indicator, mostly Health status and Education level.

The vast majority of the immigrants to Poland come from Eastern Europe, which is a majoritarily Christian Ortodox region, however the eagerness of the Polish authorities to accept their entrance is mostly due to the similarity of their cultural traits.

Eliminating the Eastern European countries from the graphic leaves a picture in which the most favoured countries when their HDI is taken into account are majoritarily Christian, and to a great extend Catholic. The graphic where countries are cloured by religion clearly shows that for HDI above 0.5 non Christian Countries have worse acceptance rates than Christian. 

In view of the analyzed data seems then that cultural closeness is an important factor in the Travel Visa Acceptance by the Polish authorities and that the professed religion might be taken as an indicator of that closeness. 
A multivariate logistic regression analysis cound give more light into that matter however, taking into account some of the outliers, like Angola, Ethiopia, South Africa or Macedonia(see the screen capture with the name outliers.jpg in this folder, more variables should be taken into account and data coming from  the reports of personal Visa requests would be necessary to eliminate possible confounders.
