# Poland Visa Permit Data
There is a lot of controversy regarding the acceptance of immigrants from countries where the cultural background and to some extent, the religion processed are very different from the majoritarily western European, white, catholic Polish population. 
This study tries to assess whether there is a religious bias in the Visa Permit procedure (travel, work or study VISA) affecting the Visa Permit process chances of being accepted or rejected.
Another bias that could be expected is to easier accept persons coming from more developed countries where the health and education systems facilitate people achieving more in life. The Human Development Index (HDI) is an idicator that summarizes all that. 

Information on the HDI can be found here:

The databases used have been the register of Visa petitions to enter Poland for the year 2019 and the ARDA (Association of Religion Data Archives) Cross-National Socio-Economic and Religion Data (2011).

The ARDA database was actualized up to the year 2010. No significative changes were assumed in macro economy indicators like the Human Development Index (HDI) or the most professed religions by country.

There are only two years in the Polish Travel Visa database, 2018 and 2019, I decided to included only one year because neither politically, economically or almost in any sense are there any important differences between both years and because two years is too little to show any temporal progression.
